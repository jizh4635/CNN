Brief description of the problem and data\n\nThe rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have led to significant progress in various domains. Now, we have a chance to utilize AI to tackle the problem of identifying metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is better to solve this kind of a binary image classification problem, where the goal is to determine whether a given image patch contains metastatic cancer or not. The data for this challenge is based on the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset, which has been modified to remove duplicate images. PCam dataset is interesting due to its size, simplicity, and approachability. It allows for models to be trained on a single GPU within a few hours and achieve competitive scores. As for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, it involves the processing, understanding, and generation of human language by computer algorithms. NLP techniques are widely used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbot development.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.
